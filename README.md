## Description
For our exam, we were assigned to create a blog with a topic of our choice. The blog needed to have a functional login system, a feature to delete posts, edit posts, and create new posts. Additionally, it had to include a carousel that stops when hovered over, rather than operating automatically. All images had to be incorporated via URLs through an API.

My blog focused on outdoor activities. I chose to concentrate on component-based JavaScript for this project, which proved to be very educational.
