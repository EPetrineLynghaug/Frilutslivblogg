Report: Emphasizing Component-Based Coding in JavaScript

In this project, I have chosen to focus on learning component-based coding.
Advantages of Component-Based Coding in Plain JavaScript

Adopting a component-based approach in JavaScript, even without libraries like React, offers several significant benefits:

   1. Reusability: Components can be easily reused across the application, reducing repetitive code and enhancing development efficiency.

   2.  Modularity: Each component encapsulates its own logic and style, making the codebase more organized, structured, and easier to maintain.

    3. Scalability: By breaking the application into smaller, manageable components, it becomes easier to scale and expand functionality.

   4.  Improved Testability: Isolated components can be tested individually, leading to more reliable code and simpler debugging.

    5. Simplified Debugging: Clearly defined component boundaries make it easier to locate and fix errors, improving error handling and reducing development time.

By implementing a component-based architecture, one achieves a more robust, maintainable, and efficient development process, even when working with plain JavaScript.
